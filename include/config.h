// FAIRY_TYPE_IMPLEMENTED should be used if you implemented the fairy type over type slot 9 using hgss-filesys-example's fairy branch.
// for this project, it is used to adjust the mega stone item gfx start, as the pixie plate
// should shift all of the item gfx.

// START_ADDRESS should be the same as armips/include/config.h's START_ADDRESS so that hall of fame/pokéathlon overworlds work properly.
// START_ADDRESS defines the file address within the synthetic overlay where you would like to place all of the code that this project uses.  this is largely the repointed tables that the code uses.
// if START_ADDRESS is 0x10000, then the tables will be inserted at address 0x10000 of the synthetic overlay
// the current implementation (with all gen 5 mons) uses ~9222/0x2406 bytes.  make sure this points to that much free space (probably allow for a little bit more than that)
#define START_ADDRESS 0x0

// EXPERIENCE_FORMULA_GEN defines the experience formula you would like to use.  Gens 5, 7, and 8 consider the difference between the attacker's level and the fainted's level to scale the experience gained.
// i.e. defining this as "5", "7", or "8" would use a scaled formula, whereas "6" and others would use the default formula.  There is a multiplier of 255 / 390 to not artificially inflate the experience given as well with higher base experience.
#define EXPERIENCE_FORMULA_GEN 8

// HIDDEN_ABILITIES defines whether or not Pokémon with their hidden ability bit set will receive their hidden abilities when being generated/changing form in battle.
// commenting this line out essentially disables hidden abilities to maintain default behavior, while leaving this as-is will introduce hidden abilities and all of their handling.
#define HIDDEN_ABILITIES

// MEGA_EVOLUTIONS defines whether or not Pokémon that are able to mega evolve will be able to do so.
// commenting this line out essentially disables mega evolutions and maintains default behavior with respect to them.  leaving this as-is will introduce mega evolutions when applied to the game.
#define MEGA_EVOLUTIONS

// PRIMAL_REVERSION defines whether or not Kyogre and Groudon, when holding their orbs, will be able to change form when sent out in battle.
// commenting this line out essentially disables primarl reversion.  leaving this as-is will introduce primal reversions when applied to the game.
