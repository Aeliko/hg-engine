// START_ADDRESS defines the file address within the synthetic overlay where you would like to place all of the code that this project uses.  this is largely the repointed tables that the code uses.
// if START_ADDRESS is 0x10000, then the tables will be inserted at address 0x10000 of the synthetic overlay
// the current implementation (with all gen 5 mons) uses ~9222/0x2406 bytes.  make sure this points to that much free space (probably allow for a little bit more than that)
